# About repository ✨

Hello👋 and welcome to my competitive programming related repository "interview-prep"! Here I will post my solutions for various programming problems 🧩 presented in Leetcode, GFG and others.

My solutions may be ineffective, complex or confusing, since I, like many others, are constantly learning, including how to effectively solve hard programming problems💫. Most of my solutions will be presented in C++ or Python, since this is the language I know best 😊.

I will be grateful🍀 if you give my repository a "⭐" if you find it interesting or useful. More detailed information on each section can be found below. Happy coding💻!

## Leetcode 🎩

Here you can find solutions for these types of problems: dailys, contests (those that I managed to solve), study plans (such as the top 150 interviews) and just problems that I solved out of boredom😴.  
My Leetcode account: [link](https://leetcode.com/KailasMahavarkar/)  
The Leetcode solutions folder is structured📋 somehow like this:

```

Structure:
├── [<Topic> Concept]📁
│   └── (question_name).cpp📜
├── [<Topic> Question]📁
│   └── (question_name)_(question_id)_(platform).cpp📜
└── leetcode📁
    └── (question_name)_(question_id)_(platform).cpp📜


Example:
├── Array Concept📁
│   └── prefix_sum.py
├── Array Question📁
│   └── common_elements_3_sorted.cpp📜
└── leetcode📁
    ├── bus_routes_leetcode_815.cpp📜
    └── course_schedule_leetcode_207.cpp📜

```

P.S. The file for one solution may contain several "Solution" classes (several methods have been found) or a re-solution of the problem (if the first solution was not optimal).

There May Exists some custom developed algorithms Which I could not find over internet, they are developed by me, and I will mention them in the file itself.
